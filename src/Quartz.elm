{-| This is the base optic type. All other optics are defined in terms of this
type.

Don't be intimidated by all the type variables! Here's what they mean:

  - `p`: Does this optic support being used as a prism? This will either be
    `Yes` or `No`.

  - `l`: Does this optic support being used as a lens? Like `p`, this will
    either be `Yes` or `No`.

  - `s`: This is the input type. Often this is a "big" type like a record.

  - `t`: This is the output type. Often this is the same as the input type, but
    that's not required.

  - `a`: This is the input type of the focused element. Often this is a "small"
    type like one field in a record.

  - `b`: This is the output type of the focused element. Often this is the same
    as the input type, but that's not required.

-}
type alias SimpleOptic p l s a =

{-| Equivalent to `()`, the unit type. Used to signal that an `Optic` supports
a certain feature.
-}
type alias Yes =
    Quartz.Type.Yes.Yes


{-| Equivalent to `Never`, the empty type. Like `Yes`, this is used to signal
that an `Optic` does not support a certain feature.
-}

{-| This is a `Traversal` where the input and output types are the same.
-}
type alias SimpleTraversal s a =

{-| Use this function to create a new `Traversal`. You have to provide a way to
convert the input into a `List`, as well as a way to map over values in the
input.

{-| Maps the given function over the `Optic`. If the `Optic` doesn't match,
nothing will happen. See `set` for a similar function that unconditionally sets
the value rather than updating it.
